My Mac recently became unresponsive to **ESC** key, and that too while working inside **vim**. Without escape key, how could I work in vim? It started getting into my nerves. Unable to come out of the insert mode, I tried other terminal applications wondering if it is something to do with the terminal app I used (iTerm). The same problem existed in other terminal applications as well as other usual applications like Safari. I didn't want to simply restart either. Thankfully [this stackoverflow thread](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65974/os-x-esc-key-stops-working-randomly) came to my rescue. Little did I know that the problem could be related to Siri. Too bad that Siri can't kill herself. So I killed Siri and rescued my precious **ESC** key.
