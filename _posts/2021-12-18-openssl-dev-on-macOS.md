A quick note to myself. When installing `openssl` through `brew` on macOS, the installation is not symlinked into `/usr/local`.

```text
~ % brew info openssl@1.1            
openssl@1.1: stable 1.1.1l (bottled) [keg-only]
Cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit
https://openssl.org/
/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1l_1 (8,073 files, 18.5MB)

Required: ca-certificates âœ”
==> Caveats
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

openssl@1.1 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@1.1 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"

**brew** installs the requested version of openssl into `/usr/local/Cellar/` and creates a symlink at `/usr/local/opt/openssl`. We can set the options `-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include` and `-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/` when compiling the application that uses the version of openssl symlinked into `/usr/local/opt/openssl/`. I was playing with only one version (1.1.1), so didn't have to worry about maintaining different versions on the system. Having the libs and include files symlinked into `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include` takes out the hassle of setting the preprocessor options each time.
