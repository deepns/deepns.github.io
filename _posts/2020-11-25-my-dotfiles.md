With frequent switches between work and personal dev environment, having a consistent experience across the different environment is super important. I go crazy when I have to use alternate between different set of keystrokes and shortcuts between the different environments. At one point, I had to work on Ubuntu and Windows VMs on a macOS host for several weeks due to the nature of the projects. Often I learn new shortcuts, aliases, hot keys and customizations while working on new projects. The common components that I customize are **bash, tmux, zsh, vim and gnu-screen**. Bringing these customizations under git made it much easier for me to manage them and sync between different dev environments.
