[This](https://amzn.to/380aZRl) is the weirdest book I have read yet. Many facts and subjects discussed in this book are so morbid and dark that one would normally never want to know, but will inevitably face them at some point in life especially if one is considering organ or whole body donation for medical research. It was interesting to know how cadavers as a whole and in parts are used in many different fields (automobiles, ammunition research, military, aviation, injury analysis, medical examination and many more). Some of the applications and the biological processing of cadavers involved in them were unheard of, but so true in medical science and research. The chapter "Eat me" which talks about cannibalism and its different forms in present and in the past was the toughest to read.
