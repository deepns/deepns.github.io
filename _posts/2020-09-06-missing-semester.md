I happened to stumble upon on one of the videos from [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) series from MIT on YouTube and ended up almost binge watching the entire playlist. These are lectures from a group of PhD students at MIT. It turned out to be a great refresher on many different topics. There were quite a few aha moments where I thought how did I miss finding that this long, especially on some of the topics under [Command Line Environment](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/), [Vim](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/) and [debugging](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/debugging-profiling/). Though the concepts were quite familiar, I kept learning something new in every lecture. Kudos and thanks to the presenters [Anish](https://twitter.com/anishathalye), [Jon](https://twitter.com/jonhoo) and [Jose](https://twitter.com/jjgort) for making this available on YouTube.
