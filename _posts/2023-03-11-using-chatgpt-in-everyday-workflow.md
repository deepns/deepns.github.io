A few months ago, ChatGPT was made generally available and like many others, I was in awe of its technology, power, and most importantly, its simplicity of use. After the initial fun of exploring it, I didn't use it much. But slowly, the usage of ChatGPT started to climb up and I now find it so useful in a myriad of use cases. In this post, I will share some of the ways I use ChatGPT in my daily life and why I love it.

**Writing Code**: ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful in writing small Bash and Python scripts and tools. All I have to do is provide the requirements and it spits out beautiful code solving the given problem. The clarity of the answer depends on the clarity of the question, which is why I appreciate how it forces me to think and explain the requirements in simple terms. I also use it to write starter code, class definitions, templates and unit tests.

**Summarizing Code:** I often use ChatGPT to summarize long lines of code. This makes it easier for me to understand and troubleshoot, especially when dealing with complex codebases. I do this only on opensource code though.

**Writing queries, commands**: Generating jq queries for complex data can be time-consuming, but ChatGPT can generate them quickly and accurately. I also find it useful to write shell commands that otherwise required me to read the man pages and find the options and syntax by myself.

**Generating Test Data**: ChatGPT can create test data in formats like JSON and YAML, making it a great tool for manual data entry.

**Proofreading Content**: ChatGPT can help me check content for language, grammar, and correctness. This is incredibly helpful, especially when I need to write professional emails, feedback, or reviews. (p.s. this post also went through this exercise ðŸ˜„)

**Creative Writing**: I also use ChatGPT to make up stories with different characters and themes to tell to my kid.

I briefly tried the new Bing with ChatGPT and Neeva, but I found that the user experience and result correctness weren't as good as ChatGPT.

I don't know much about the AI technology behind ChatGPT, but I am super optimistic about the future powered by tools like ChatGPT. I believe that ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and communicate. It simplifies tasks, improves efficiency, and challenges us to think more clearly and communicate more effectively. ChatGPT has become an essential tool in my daily life, and I'm so excited to see how it will continue to evolve in the future.
