I'm a software engineer based in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am interested in backend technologies, systems programming, language learning (human and programming) and reading books (mostly non-fictional). I like to write about various things that I learn from my work, personal projects, books and whatever else is interesting at present. Thanks for stopping by my page.
